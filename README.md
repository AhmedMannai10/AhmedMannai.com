Welcome to my personal portfolio and blog website! [ahmedmannai.com](https://ahmedmannai.com)  This site was built using Next.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS.

Next.js is a framework for building React applications with server-rendering capabilities. This allows for improved performance and SEO.

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides a variety of tools and services for building and managing web and mobile applications. I have used Firebase as my database and hosting.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create fast-loading, highly-readable, and fully-responsive user interfaces. I have used tailwind css to design my website's UI.

This website serves as both my personal portfolio and blog, showcasing my work and thoughts on various topics. Feel free to take a look around and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
